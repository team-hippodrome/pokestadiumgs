## 2026-10-27 — `func_84143E64`: matched

Draws a name label: `color = func_80064474(kind, id)`, copy 12 bytes of the name, draw them with `func_800495F8(x, y, 1, buf)`, then a marker at `(x + 21, y + 10)` coloured 169/190 for `color` 1/2. `x`/`y` are `u16` (retail reloads them with `lhu` from their homes; the callers' extern is retyped to match); `kind` is read back as the low byte of its homed word (`lbu 0x4B(sp)`), spelled `*((u8 *)&arg2 + 3)` (`// FAKE`). `func_800495F8` is now declared varargs (`(s32, s32, s32, void *, ...)`) throughout the file, which leaves every existing caller byte-identical.

## 2026-10-27 — `func_84143F18`: requeue

requeue. Same head as `func_84143E64`; for kinds 29/32 it draws the name directly when it equals `func_800625E0(buf)` (`HAL_Strcmp`), otherwise `func_800495F8(x, y, 1, D_8418B1C4, name, colour)` (varargs). Declaring `color` before `u8 buf[12]` fixes the frame; the only remaining diff is the reloaded kind byte landing in `v0` instead of retail's `a1` (register tie, `kind` locals/`switch` do not move it). Permuter 240 s: 15 → 15.

## 2026-10-27 — `func_8413E410`: requeue

requeue. Finds or allocates a name slot: walk the 0x7A-byte slots from `D_8419C0C0` to `D_8419D7A0`; return if a slot's tag equals `arg0`, else claim the first empty slot and `sprintf(slot + 1, func_8004C874(7, arg0 - 1))`. A `do`/`while` with the end test at the bottom gives the right body (0.94); retail's frame is 0x28 with the cursor spilled at `sp+0x18` and computes the end pointer into `a0` first, while IDO uses a 0x20 frame (an explicit `end` local makes it worse). Stack-diff permuter: 226 → 61.
